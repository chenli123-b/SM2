Every year, March 8th is women's day. The purpose of this day is to remind people of the equality between men and women. In the job market, it is the open secret that women are paid less than men on the same work, which is not fair. So in order to change this situation, more and more people join the activity to advocate more rights for women. Today, the situation has been improved. Some laws are made to protect women's rights, but it is still the long way to go before the real equality. Women manage the work and the family chores. They are doing the great work and deserve to be respected.
